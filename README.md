# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Reservation System ‚Äì SQL Project

This repository contains a SQL-based Airline Reservation System designed during my internship at **Elevate Labs**. The project showcases database design and management skills using MySQL, covering schema creation, data insertion, queries, joins, stored procedures, triggers, and views.

---

## Project Overview
The Airline Reservation System models a real-world scenario for managing flights, customers, bookings, and seat availability. It demonstrates **SQL DDL and DML operations**, normalization, constraints, and advanced SQL features.

---

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Triggers, Views, Procedures)

---

## üìÇ Contents
- `airline_schema.sql` ‚Äì SQL script for schema creation
- `sample_data.sql` ‚Äì Insert statements for sample records
- `queries.sql` ‚Äì SELECT, JOIN, AGGREGATE, and subqueries
- `procedures_and_triggers.sql` ‚Äì Stored procedures and triggers
- `views.sql` ‚Äì Views for flight availability and summaries
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project documentation

---

## üî• Features
- Normalized schema with proper relationships
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
- Aggregate functions with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Stored Procedures and Functions for reusable logic
- Triggers for automated seat management
- Views for easy reporting of bookings and availability



## My Internship Experience at Elevate Labs
During my internship, I worked on real-world SQL projects like this Airline Reservation System. I learned how to:
- Design normalized schemas with relationships.
- Write complex SQL queries with joins, aggregates, and subqueries.
- Automate database operations using procedures and triggers.
- Build reusable views for quick analytics.

This experience strengthened my database design skills and taught me best practices for writing efficient and clean SQL code.

## ‚úÖ Outcome
This project reflects my ability to build and manage a relational database for real-world use cases, making it a solid addition to my portfolio for future roles in database development or backend engineering.
